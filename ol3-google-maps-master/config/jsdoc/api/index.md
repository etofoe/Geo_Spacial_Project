#### API change policy

The OL-Google-Maps API consists of
* names and signatures of constructors
* names and signatures of instance methods and properties
* names and signatures of functions
* names of constants

Within a major release series, the API will not be changed.  Any changes to the API will be accompanied by a new major release.

*Note*: The API change policy does not cover CSS class names that are used to style the OL-Google-Maps UI. It also does not cover any typedefs and enums.
