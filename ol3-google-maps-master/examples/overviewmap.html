  <p>
    This example shows a Google Maps layer being used in an overview
    control.
  </p>
  <p>
    Since the overview control contains a different map instance, we
    also need an different olGM instance for it.
  </p>
  <p>
    There are two google maps layers visible at the same time, we need
    to load them in sequence. As soon as the google maps instance in the
    overview control is done loading, we activate the main one. When
    using only one google maps layer, no delay is necessary.
