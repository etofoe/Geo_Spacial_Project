shortdesc: Example where layers can be re-ordered.
docs: >
  In this example, layers are displayed in the table.
  They can be re-ordered by clicking the arrow buttons
  next to their names. The top-most layers will display in
  front of the layers placed below them in the table. The base
  Google layer is not affected by this, it will always display
  behind every layer. Vector layers will also always display in
  front of every layer while Google Maps is active.
