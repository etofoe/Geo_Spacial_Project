  <p>
    A simple map containing a single Google layer. OpenLayers is
    on top of Google Maps and controls all interactions on the map.
  </p>
  <p>
    As soon as the OpenLayers map has a visible Google layer
    in it, the Google Maps map is activated by the library,
    which puts the OpenLayers map on top of the Google Maps one.
